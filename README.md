# Beginner Rust Logic Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Rust programs designed to help new learners practice fundamental programming concepts. Each program focuses on basic logic building rather than advanced syntax, making it suitable for anyone starting with Rust.

The exercises emphasize core ideas such as working with variables, input and output, conditional statements, loops, simple data handling, and early algorithmic thinking. The goal is to build comfort with problem solving step by step while becoming familiar with Rust’s structure and style.

What this repository includes

Programs in this repository cover:
Simple problems that strengthen logical thinking
Practice with variables and data types
Use of conditional flow such as if-else statements
Different looping patterns
Basic algorithmic exercises such as counting, searching, or simple calculations

All examples are intentionally small and focused so that learners can experiment and modify them without feeling overwhelmed.

Who this is for

This repository is intended for:
Beginners learning Rust for the first time
Students practicing programming logic
Anyone transitioning to Rust from another language
Self-learners who prefer practical examples over theory only

No prior Rust knowledge is strictly required, but basic programming ideas such as variables and loops are helpful.

How to use the programs

Install Rust using the official toolchain installer (rustup).
Clone or download this repository.
Open any program file inside the src or examples folder, depending on your structure.
Run programs using cargo run or rustc filename.rs depending on how your project is organized.

Feel free to edit programs, add your own variations, or combine multiple concepts in new files.

Learning approach

Each program is meant to be read, modified, and re-run. Try things such as:
Changing values of variables
Adding extra conditions
Adding print statements to observe behavior
Expanding simple exercises into slightly larger problems

The more you experiment, the faster logic skills develop.

Contribution

Suggestions, improvements, or additional beginner-friendly Rust exercises are welcome. If you want to add programs, keep them clear, commented, and focused on learning value.
