# Rust Logic Building – Beginner

1. **Variable Swapping**
Write a program that declares two integer variables with different values. Implement logic to swap their values so that the first variable holds the second variable's value and vice versa, then print the results.

2. **Even or Odd Checker**
Create a program that accepts a single integer input from the user. Use a conditional statement to check if the number is even or odd and print the corresponding message to the console.

3. **The Largest of Three**
Write a program that takes three distinct integers as input. Use a series of `if` and `else` statements to determine and print which of the three numbers is the largest.

4. **Simple Grading System**
Develop a program that accepts a student's numeric score (0–100). Classify the score into a grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on specific ranges (e.g., 90–100 is 'A') and print the grade.

5. **Multiplication Table generator**
Write a program that asks the user for a single integer. Use a `for` loop to print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10 (e.g., "5 x 1 = 5").

6. **Sum of Natural Numbers**
Create a program that accepts a positive integer `N`. Use a loop to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 up to and including `N`, then display the total.

7. **Factorial Calculator**
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer provided by the user. The logic should use a loop to multiply the numbers and return the result for printing.

8. **Count Digits in a Number**
Write a program that takes an integer input (e.g., 54321). Use a `while` loop and mathematical operations (division and modulo) to count how many digits are in the number. Do not convert the number to a string.

9. **Prime Number Checker**
Create a program that accepts a positive integer. Implement logic using a loop to check if the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Print "Prime" or "Not Prime" based on the result.

10. **Number Reverser**
Write a program that accepts an integer (e.g., 1234). Using a loop and mathematical operations (multiplication, division, and modulo) construct a new integer that is the reverse of the input (e.g., 4321) and print it.
